-Middle ware are fns that have access to req,res object and next middleware fn in the req-res cycle
ex:app.get('/',function(req,res,next){-the middelware function
    next()-when we do ops on req/res after that we need to call the next fn then our app listens to port
})

-'/' is the path for which the middleware applies
-here req,res are args to mddleware fns and next is a callback to middleware function
